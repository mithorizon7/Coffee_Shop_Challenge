Without verification, you had no way to distinguish the real network from a well-crafted fake. The 30 seconds it takes to ask staff could prevent hours of dealing with compromised accounts. Building the habit of verification is more important than any single safe connection.",
          "saferAlternative": "Before connecting to any public network, ask staff for the exact network name. It only takes a moment, and it turns guessing into a more informed choice. This habit greatly reduces the risk of evil-twin networks, but you should still stay alert for look-alike names and unexpected login pages.",
