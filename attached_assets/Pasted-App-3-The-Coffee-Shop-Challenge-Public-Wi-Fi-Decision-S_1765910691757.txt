App 3 — The Coffee Shop Challenge (Public Wi-Fi Decision Simulator)
Purpose

Train judgment under ambiguity. Teach:

How public Wi-Fi risks often come from deception, not movie hacking

A repeatable decision process:

choose networks carefully

avoid sensitive actions on suspicious networks

prefer HTTPS; use VPN where appropriate

don’t install random profiles/apps from captive portals

Core UX concept

A short scenario game with:

a Wi-Fi menu (3–5 networks)

a set of tasks (“check email,” “log in,” “download a file,” “pay”)

timed prompts / distractions (optional)

a consequence engine that produces believable outcomes

Avoid cartoon outcomes

Instead of “wallet drains to $0,” use realistic consequence types:

Credential harvested by phishing portal

Session token compromised after a bad decision

Malware prompt accepted

Account lock due to suspicious login

Privacy leakage / tracking increase

Keep it dramatic, but plausible.

Game loop

Arrive at café/hotel

Choose a network

Encounter a portal or login task

Choose actions (connect, verify, use VPN, postpone, switch networks)

Consequence + debrief

Score + badge + “what to do next time”

Mechanics to implement
A) Risk scoring

Use a transparent, educational scoring model:

“Risk points” increase for:

connecting to suspicious SSID

logging into sensitive accounts on unknown network

installing anything prompted

“Safety points” increase for:

choosing secured network

using VPN on public Wi-Fi

postponing sensitive actions

verifying SSID with staff (simulation)

B) Debrief after every consequence

Each consequence screen must answer:

What you did

Why it was risky/safe

What a safer alternative was

C) Difficulty levels

Beginner: obvious trap network names

Intermediate: subtle SSID confusion (similar names)

Advanced: time pressure + plausible prompts

Build requirements

Branching narrative engine (state machine):

scenes, choices, consequences, and scoring

Content files separated from code:

JSON for scenes and outcomes so educators can edit without redeploying logic

Security posture

No real network data. No real browsing. No external links required.
