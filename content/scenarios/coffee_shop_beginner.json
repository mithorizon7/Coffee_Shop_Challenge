Modern browsers usually catch fake certificates, but misconfigured devices or outdated software might not. Attackers can also use DNS spoofing to redirect you to a fake bank website that looks identical to the real one.

        "whatHappened": "You used a VPN before accessing your bank account. This adds a crucial layer of encryption that prevents anyone on the coffee shop network from seeing or interfering with your banking session.",
        "whyRisky": "This was an excellent decision. The VPN creates an encrypted tunnel that blocks all local network attacks - no one at the coffee shop can perform man-in-the-middle attacks, DNS spoofing, or traffic analysis. The remaining risk is minimal: you're trusting your VPN provider (choose wisely) and the bank's own security (which is typically very strong).",
        "saferAlternative": "For the most sensitive transactions like large transfers or changing account settings, mobile data is still the gold standard. But VPN on public Wi-Fi is a solid, practical choice that provides strong protection for everyday banking.",
        "technicalExplanation": "The VPN encrypts all traffic before it leaves your device, making local network attacks impossible. Your banking session travels through the encrypted tunnel to the VPN server, then to your bank. Local attackers see only encrypted gibberish going to a single VPN IP address.",

        "title": "Excellent Judgment",
        "whatHappened": "You recognized that banking is a high-stakes activity and chose to postpone it until you're on a trusted network. This is exactly the right instinct for protecting your finances.",
        "whyRisky": "There is no risk because you didn't expose your banking credentials to a public network at all. This 'security by avoidance' approach is often the wisest choice for critical operations. The minor inconvenience of waiting is nothing compared to the potential consequences of a compromised bank account.",
        "saferAlternative": "You made the best possible decision. Banking should be reserved for networks you control - your home Wi-Fi, your workplace network, or your phone's mobile data connection. The $200 bill can wait until you're in a secure environment.",
        "technicalExplanation": "By postponing high-sensitivity tasks, you eliminate the attack surface entirely. Attackers can't steal what you never exposed. This approach recognizes that convenience is not worth the risk when it comes to your financial security.",
