For a presentation that might contain pricing, strategy, or client information, this exposure matters.",

While HTTPS protects file contents in transit, DNS queries reveal which cloud services you're using. Sophisticated attackers could attempt to redirect you to fake download pages or intercept your connection before encryption is established. Major cloud services use security measures like HSTS to prevent many attacks, but a VPN eliminates these risks entirely.",
