The VPN encrypts all traffic before it touches the airport network, blocking all local network attacks. Anyone monitoring the airport Wi-Fi sees only encrypted traffic going to a VPN server - they can't tell you're signing a contract, can't intercept your credentials, and can't tamper with the transaction.",
        "saferAlternative": "This was a good decision. For maximum security on legal documents, mobile data remains the gold standard since it bypasses local networks entirely. But VPN on public Wi-Fi is a practical, effective choice that provides strong protection.",
        "technicalExplanation": "VPN encryption wraps your entire signing session in an encrypted tunnel. The airport network sees only encrypted packets going to your VPN provider's IP address. Session hijacking, DNS spoofing, and traffic analysis become impossible for local attackers.",

It took courage to ask for an extension under pressure, but you recognized that the risk to both parties wasn't worth the time savings.

They now know you take information security seriously, which matters when you're handling their sensitive contract.
